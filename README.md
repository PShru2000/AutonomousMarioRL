# Autonomous Gameplay in Super Mario Bros. Using Reinforcement Learning



## Problem Statement 
The objective of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning algorithm capable of autonomously navigating and completing the first level of the Super Mario Bros. game. This entails developing a system that can understand and interact with the game environment in real-time, making decisions to move Mario through the level efficiently and reach the flag at the end of the level as quickly as possible
