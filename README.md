# Autonomous Gameplay in Super Mario Bros. Using Reinforcement Learning



## Problem Statement 
The objective of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning algorithm capable of autonomously navigating and completing the first level of the Super Mario Bros. game. This entails developing a system that can understand and interact with the game environment in real-time, making decisions to move Mario through the level efficiently and reach the flag at the end of the level as quickly as possible. Here the  game is expressed as a sequence of states(s), actions(a) and rewards(r).

## Installations

- Python
- Pytorch
- TensorFlow
- Gym
- MATLAB

## Setting up the Environment

Created a virtual environment and installed gym-super-mario-bros with **pip install gym-super-mario-bros** for Super Mario Bros. gameplay with reinforcement learning.


## Algorithms implemented
